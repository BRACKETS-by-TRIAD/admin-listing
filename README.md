# Admin Listing

AdminListing is a helper that simplifies administration listing for your Eloquent models. It helps transforming a typical request to data. It can auto-handle all the basic stuff like pagination, ordering, search. It can handle also translatable eloquent models (see [Translatable Eloquent Models](https://docs.brackets.sk/#/translatable#make-your-model-translatable)).
